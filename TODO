PROFESSOR2 TO-DO LIST
=====================

- Add prof-ipol, prof-tune, prof-viz

- Move ipol Histo persistency to/from functions to prof2.io package

   => IHisto direct persistency functions?

- Smart Bin access to y val and err(s), i.e. without necessarily exposing Ipols to user

- Need to abstract types a bit more for 2D histos, unbinned histos, etc?

   Need to specialise for profiles

- Provide chi2(ih, dh) fuction in prof2.stats package

- Provide easy plotting functions for scatters, contours, and 3D in prof2.plotting package

- IHisto => DHisto function

- Move Sampler => prof2.sampling?

- Move Histo, etc. => prof2.data, prof2.ipol?

- Add path, title, xy labels properties to Histo

- Remove uncatchable calls to exit() and I/O streams

   Prefer to throw exceptions / return strings directly, and when a print
   function is needed, give it an optional arg to specify the target stream.

- Is Boost needed?

   Can't it be replaced by C++11 std:: functionality, and maybe a little bit of
   writing our own string utils?
