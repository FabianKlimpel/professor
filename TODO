PROFESSOR2 TO-DO LIST
=====================

- Add scripts

   prof-ipol, prof-tune, prof-viz

- Would a grouped Ipols object be useful to manage the Ipol to/from file/string?

- Remove uncatchable calls to exit() and I/O streams

   Prefer to throw exceptions / return strings directly, and when a print
   function is needed, give it an optional arg to specify the target stream.

- Is Boost needed?

   Can't it be replaced by C++11 std:: functionality, and maybe a little bit of
   writing our own string utils?
