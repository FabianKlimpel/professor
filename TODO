PROFESSOR2 TO-DO LIST
=====================

- Add Professor namespace in C++

   And re-think whether we need to explicitly name the Python module 'professor2' (probably yes)

- Remove uncatchable calls to exit() and I/O streams

   Prefer to throw exceptions / return strings directly, and when a print
   function is needed, give it an optional arg to specify the target stream.

- Is Boost needed?

   Can't it be replaced by C++11 std:: functionality, and maybe a little bit of
   writing our own string utils?
