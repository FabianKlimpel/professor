Professor 2.0 all new, all shiny.



Type 'make' from the base directory to build everything.

Binaries and python extensions are installed to $PWD.

Sourcing the setup.sh script should work.

python
import profdriver




Development goals:
  * Small, flexible code
  * Core functionality (parametrisation, getValue) in C++, cython bindings to be used in scripts,
    histogram agnostic (no yoda for sampling, interpolate)
  * Parametrisation output in ASCII ('ProfDF') for portability, human readability
  * sampling of parameter points: heavy use of library function
  
  * YODA dependence for ipolhistos, tune:
    * use BinFinder of YODA for clever magic
    * populate ProfDriver (name subject to change) from yoda files --- wrapper

  * complete rewrites:
    * prof-I

  * cull:
    * pickle output
    * sensitivities
    * support for anything besides pyminuit
