	* Remove bound ParamPoints pointer from Ipol, and ditch lazy coeff evaluation in favour of simplicity and construct-time coeff calculating.

	* Move long vector and coeff building into unbound functions rather than Ipol methods.

	* Start of ChangeLog. Library has already iterated quite a bit.

	* FILL IN EARLY HISTORY FROM HG LOG
